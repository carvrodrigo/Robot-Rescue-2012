This repository includes the entire Rescue B project from 2012, used in the international RoboCup Rescue B league.
Our team could acomplish the 3th place in super-team and 1st place of robot design.

There is a currently new version of it (on the picture, the 2013 one), find out more [here](https://github.com/ivanseidel/Robot-Rescue-2013).

This robot was the first Android based robot, that used the cellphone as the main processor and could controll the entirely the robot. We could acomplish heavy calculations using Android's 2.4Ghz processor, creating really "expensive" euristics.

The software has about 12.000 lines of code, written in Java, using Interfaces, and Classes hierarchy to provide well encapsulated code, and easy to use.

The image bellow is the sketch of the sensors/controllers.
